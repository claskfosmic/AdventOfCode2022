# Advent Of Code 2022
Joining the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) this year. Deciced to write everything in Python to learn more/challenge myself.

For each day, I'll add an directory, called dayXX, with the following files:

 - day.py (*The class/module to import and run*)
 - input.txt (*My personal input*)
 - example.txt (*Example data*)

Using AdventOfCode.py, which will take care of the reading the input for each day, I'm able to solve (*the parts of the*) puzzle of all the different days.

## Usage:

Run all:

```
./AdventOfCode.py
```
Run day 1 (both, part 1 and 2):

```
./AdventOfCode.py 1
```

Run day 1, only part 1:

```
./AdventOfCode.py 1 1
```

Run day 1, only part 2:

```
./AdventOfCode.py 1 2
```

### Testing, using the example:

In order to debug and test my code, I've also added the possibility to run a day, using the example input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). When my answer is wrong, I can solve the puzzle, using the example input to try if I get the same answer as in the example.
